title: "System Design - Sharding"
---

A technique to break up a big database into many smaller parts. Horizontal scaling means adding more machines, which is cheaper and more feasible. Vertical scaling means improves servers. 

## Sharding methods

### Horizontal partitioning
 Putting different rows into different DBs. i.e., based on alphabetically names. Unbalanced partitions.

### Vertical partitioning
 Divide tables based on features. I.e, for user or location. Also inbalanced partitions. Best if most of the time, only partial data in a row is required. But still might result int horizontal partition, which becomes very complicate.

### Directory based partitioning:
Each row has a DB number, a map between row and DB number.

## Sharding Criteria

Hash based:
 Using hashcode on entity value
List Partioning:
 based on list, i.e., regions, countries, etc
Round-Robin partitioning
Composite partitioning

## Challenges
 ACID 
 Joint inefficiency
