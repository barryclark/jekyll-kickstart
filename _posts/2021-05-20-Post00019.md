### Function:
    1. Distribute load to difference server. Could be in L4 and L7 layer, TCP/IP, HTTP, etc.
    2. Check which server is available and redirect works. 
### Algorithms:
    1. Round Robin
    2. Round Robin with weighted server
    3. Least connections
    4. Least Response Time
    5. Source IP Hash
    6. URL hash
### Benefit:
    1. prevent request goes to unhealthy server
    2. prevent overloading server
    3. eliminate single point of failure
